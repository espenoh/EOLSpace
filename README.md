EOLSpace
========

Gedit plugin highlighting whitespace at the end of lines. Very useful for when editing files in projects with strict PEP8/Pylint rules.


How to install
--------------
- Close all open Gedit windows.
- Copy the *.py* and the *.plugin* to the Gedit plugin directory. This is typically */usr/lib/gedit/plugins*.
- Start Gedit and enable the plugin ("EOLSpace") from the *Plugins*-tab of *Edit*->*Preferences*.

How to use
----------
If you completed the installation above successfully there should now be an option called "Run EOLSpace check" on the *Tools* menu. Clicking it should result in all trailing whitespace on each line getting a nice highlight effect.
